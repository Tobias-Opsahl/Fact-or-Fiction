- Provide your answers in a format that is easy to copy, preferably using Python list syntax.
- Answer `True` only for claims that are actually true and `False` for all other claims.
- Include your reasoning for each answer to explain why it is `True` or `False`.

Output Format:

- Provide the answers as a Python list.
- Each list item should be a tuple containing the question number, the answer (True or False), and a brief explanation.

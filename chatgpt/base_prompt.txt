**Task:**

Determine the truth value (True or False) of the following claims based on information verifiable from Wikipedia, as represented in the DBpedia knowledge graph. Provide your answers without using real-time internet searches or code analysis, relying solely on your pre-trained knowledge.

**Instructions:**

- You will evaluate the following claims, presented one per line.
- Base your answers solely on your knowledge as of your last training cut-off.
- Provide answers in Python list syntax for easy copying.
- Respond with `True` for verifiable claims or claims that are very likely to be true, and `False` otherwise.
- Include a brief explanation for each answer, explaining your reasoning based on your pre-training.
- If the claim is vague or lacks specific information, please make an educated guess on whether it is likely to be True or False.

**Output Format:**

- Format your responses as a list in Python. Each entry should be a tuple, formatted as (claim number, answer, explanation).


**Example Claims:**

```
1. The Atatürk Monument is located in Izmir, Turkey, where the capital is Ankara.
2. Yes, Eamonn Butler's alma mater is the University of Texas System!
3. I have heard 300 North LaSalle was completed in 2009.
4. The band Clinton Gregory created the album an album in the rock style.
...
```

**Example output:**

```
[
    (1, True, "The Atatürk Monument is indeed located in Izmir, and the capital of Turkey is Ankara."),
    (2, False, "Eamonn Butler did not attend the University of Texas System; he is a British author and economist whose educational background does not include this institution."),
    (3, True, "300 North LaSalle in Chicago was indeed completed in 2009."),
    (4, False, "Clinton Gregory is primarily known as a country music artist, not rock."),
    ...

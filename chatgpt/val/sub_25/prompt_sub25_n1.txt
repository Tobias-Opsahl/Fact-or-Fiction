- Respond with `True` for verifiable claims or claims that are very likely to be true, and `False` otherwise.
- Include a brief explanation for each answer, explaining your reasoning based on your pre-training.
- If the claim is vague or lacks specific information, please make an educated guess on whether it is likely to be True or False.
